Scale mixin
===============================
The mixins provides you a cross-browser compatible method to set a transformation which scales the element.
Keep in mind that you can not mix different transformations.

Please refer to <http://caniuse.com/transforms2d> to see the browser support table of the feature.

######Example:
`.scale([value]);`

`@param {String} scale-value The scale value, you want to set`
*/

.scale(@scale-value) {
	-webkit-transform: scale(@scale-value);
	transform: scale(@scale-value);
}
