# Shopware 5 Bare Theme

## Description
The Bare Theme is boilerplate theme for Shopware 5. It only contains the HTML structure and Smarty blocks of the theme but no styling or any client side functionality.

Frameworks are great, but sometimes they make things more complicated than they need to be. Our boilerplate theme is as bare and minimal as possible. It's meant to be your starting for a fully customizable Shopware 5 theme.
