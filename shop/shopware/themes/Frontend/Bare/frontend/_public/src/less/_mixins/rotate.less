Rotate mixin
===============================================
The mixins provides you a cross-browser compatible method to set a transformation which rotates the element. Keep in
mind that you can not mix different transformations.

Please refer to <http://caniuse.com/transforms2d> to see the browser support table of the feature.

######Example:
`.rotate([value]);`

`@param {String} degree The degree value you want to set. Please keep in mind that you need to suffix the unit.`
*/

.rotate(@degree) {
	-webkit-transform: rotate(@degree);
	transform: rotate(@degree);
}
